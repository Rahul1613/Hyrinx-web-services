# Commands to Push to GitHub

# Step 1: Complete the commit (remove large files)
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Exclude large video files from Android assets - will be synced during build"

# Step 2: Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# If authentication is required:
# - Username: Rahul1613
# - Password: Use Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password)
#   Get token from: https://github.com/settings/tokens

# Alternative: If push fails due to large files still in history, use:
# git push -u origin main --force
# (Only use --force if you're sure, as it overwrites remote history)
